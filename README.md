# Finacial-Breakdown-Dashboard

This is a dashboard I created based of my financial bookkeeping for the month of Feburary. I did not do a lot of editing and creating new columns while in powershell. I did this project for fun just to mess with importing a custom background and making the visuallizaiton more aesthetic. This dashboard was not created for the purpose of gaining a greater financial insight, therefore there are not any 'groundbreaking' visualizaitons. Thank you for checking out!
